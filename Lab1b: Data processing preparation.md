# Lab4: Data procesing.

## LAB Overview

#### This lab will demonstrate:
* Creating event hubs
* Creating serverless data source


### Requirements
* Azure subscription

## Task 1: Create eventhub namespace

1.	Sign in the Azure portal at
https://portal.azure.com
2.	On the left Hub menu click on Create a resource.
3.	On the New blade click on Internet of Things and select Event Hubs.
4.	On the Create namespace blade provide the following configurations:
* Name: event-hub-student0X
* Pricing Tier: Standard
* Subscription: XXXXXX
* Resource group: student0X
* Location: West Europe
* Throughput Unit: 1
* Select Enable auto-inflate
* Specify Upper Limit: 20
When, you finish click on button Create.
5.	Next step the Azure Event Hub namespace will be deployed.

## Task 2: Create eventhub inside namespace

1. After successful deployment of Azure Event Hub, go to created service event-hub-student0X. 
You can search the service using field search Search resources, services and docs which is located at the top of Azure Portal.
2.	On the Event Hubs Namespace page click on the Event Hub button marked with a plus sign. 
3.	On the Create Event Hub blade provide the following configurations:
* Name: dataBroker
* Partition Count: 2
* Message Retention: 
* Capture: Off

## Task 3: Add consumer groups
When you finish, click on button Create.
1. On the main Overview page of Event Hubs Namespace, click on Event Hubs from the left menu.
2. On the Event Hubs page click on created instance of Event Hub - dataBroker.
3. On the instance of Event Hub â€“ dataBroker page click on Consumer groups from the left menu.
4. On the Consumer Group page click on button Consumer Group marked with plus assign and add one group called *data*.

## Task 4: Create sender container

1. Clone event-simulator app from this repository.
2. Run <code>npm install</code>
3. Copy event hub connection string from portal azure:
4. Build container.
5. Tag container and push it to your ACR.

## Task 5: Individual work
Modify your application and Dockerfile, so your application can received data from event hub.
* Sample code for receiving data from event hub in nodejs

```
const { EventHubClient, delay } = require("@azure/event-hubs");

// Define connection string and related Event Hubs entity name here
const connectionString = "";
const eventHubsName = "";

async function main() {
  const client = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionString(connectionString, eventHubsName);
  const allPartitionIds = await client.getPartitionIds();
  const firstPartitionId = allPartitionIds[0];

  const receiveHandler = client.receive(firstPartitionId, eventData => {
    console.log(`Received message: ${eventData.body} from partition ${firstPartitionId}`);
  }, error => {
    console.log('Error when receiving message: ', error)
  });

  // Sleep for a while before stopping the receive operation.
  await delay(15000);
  await receiveHandler.stop();

  await client.close();
}

main().catch(err => {
  console.log("Error occurred: ", err);
});
```
